    <p>Sarma is a traditional dish made of grape, cabbage, or other leafy vegetable leaves wrapped around a savory filling, typically of ground meat, rice, onions, and spices. It's popular in many Balkan, Middle Eastern, and Eastern European cuisines, and is usually slow-cooked in a tomato-based sauce.
